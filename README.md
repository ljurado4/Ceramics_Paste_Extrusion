## Current Standoff Distance Measurement for Precise 3D Printing â€‹ 
Using image processing techniques, including OpenCV, to detect the nozzle's contours and the plate used in 3D printing. The primary objective is to measure the vertical standoff distance between the nozzle and the plate. Current functionality detects discrepancies between manual and automated measurements, and future improvements focus on adding a fixed reference point for recalibration to enhance accuracy.

### Features
### `standoff_distance.py`
- **OpenCV Implementation**: Detects contours of the nozzle and the plate from an image.
- **Measurement Discrepancies**: Compares automatic measurements to manual ones, identifying discrepancies.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Introduce a fixed reference point using known dimensions of the nozzle.
  - Recalibrate measurements based on this fixed reference to improve accuracy.


## Slicing Development 
Implement a slicing functionality for 3D models, particularly STL files, by generating perimeter points for each layer. The script uses various techniques to read STL files, produce a viewing window of the 3D figure, and slice the object into layers with points generated in a specific order. Future development goals include handling more complex geometries and improving the slicing logic.


### Features
### `slicing.py`
- **File Reading**: Processes STL files to extract 3D geometry.
- **View Generation**: Renders a viewing window to display the 3D figure.
- **Object Slicing**:
  - Identifies perimeter vertices of the object in a clockwise direction.
  - Generates points between these vertices based on an offset.
  - Determines starting points per layer and records points in tuple form (x, y) in the generation order.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Handle perimeter points of complex geometries.
  - Add support for infill methods (radial and crosshatching).
  - Improve starting point logic and enhance file input handling and GUI.
